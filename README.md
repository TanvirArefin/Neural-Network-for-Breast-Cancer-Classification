# Neural-Network-for-Breast-Cancer-Classification
This project implements a neural network using PyTorch to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign based on features like cell nucleus characteristics (e.g., radius, texture). The model leverages a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with ReLU activation and dropout for regularization, trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.
